# Dominos---Predictive-Purchase-Order-System
This project focuses on optimizing inventory management for Dominos by developing a predictive purchase order system. Using historical sales data and ingredient requirements, the system forecasts pizza sales and calculates the required quantities of ingredients.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies for reliable analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns in historical sales data.
Time Series Forecasting: Predict future pizza sales using models like ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM.
Purchase Order Generation: Automatically calculate ingredient requirements and create a detailed purchase order for the forecasted sales period.
Business Impact: Align inventory management with sales predictions to reduce waste and improve operational efficiency.

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras
Forecasting Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Business Use Cases:
Inventory Management: Maintain optimal ingredient levels to meet future demand without overstocking.
Cost Reduction: Minimize costs related to excess inventory and expired stock.
Sales Forecasting: Inform strategic decisions and promotions using accurate sales trends.
Supply Chain Optimization: Streamline the ordering process to align with predicted sales and avoid disruptions.
